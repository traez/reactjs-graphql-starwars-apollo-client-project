## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup 
- CSS custom properties 
- Flexbox and CSS Grid 
- Mobile-first workflow 
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library 
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework  
- Tailwind CSS  
- Typescript 
- Nodejs
- Expressjs
- MongoDB
- GraphQL

### What I learned

- More comfortable understanding of using GraphQL on teh client side (React). Will next look into GraphQL server side with NextJs and also with Express Backend.

### Continued development

- Keep coding everyday and increasing competency!
